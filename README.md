# esp32-idf-presence-sensor
The repository aim to execute, control and measure results using the presence sensor HC-RS501.

I am using VS Code IDE, so if need you'd like to use it as well I recommend search for ESP-IDF on VS Code. It' not mandatory using VS Code, you can do everything on IDF terminal.
